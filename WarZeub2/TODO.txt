===============================================================================
* REFACTOR
===============================================================================
- unit 'moveState' / 'actionState' (/ 'hud state'), design is not clear
- split *real* unit and building unit hierarchy (polymorphism)
- UserInput start to get messy again
- UpdateSelection() might need to be moved somewhere else
- Map rendering should be done only on the viewport region
- It should be a state to specified when the user is in selecting mode
- Move DrawSelections() to the right place
- SDL actually sucks when a lots of sprite have to be displayed, switch to
  OpenGL/DirectX or uses the OpenGL mode of SDL (or maybe SDL2.0?)
===============================================================================


===============================================================================
* BUG
===============================================================================
- Right clicking very near a 'stopped' peon and the move animation continue or
  when a lag occurs (convergence issue?)

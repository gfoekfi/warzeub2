* FEATURE
===============================================================================
- multiple unit selection
- smart unit selection (unit > building)
- make gold gathering effective (resource earned)
- music / sound
- alert system (not enough resource, under-attack...)
- sprite mirroring
- keyboard shortcut (grid / first letter)
- tree handling
- group selection save/restore handling
- fog of war
- render building that will be constructed
- render minimap
- move with minimap
- write a README
===============================================================================


===============================================================================
* REFACTOR
===============================================================================
- unit 'actionState' is ambiguous
- unit order => polymorphism (read below)
- split *real* unit and building unit hierarchy (polymorphism)
- Map rendering should be done only on the viewport region
- Move DrawSelections() to the right place
- SDL actually sucks when a lots of sprite have to be displayed, switch to
  OpenGL/DirectX or uses the OpenGL mode of SDL (or maybe SDL2.0?)
- Clean not necessary header inclusions
- All the 'Sint16()' type conversion looks crappy (might change if we don't uses
  SDL anymore and its SDL_Rect)
- Try bounding sphere instead of bounding box
- Makes every *time related* stuff synchronised on frame (network preparation)
- Path finding should uses A-star
- Change map representation (2d grid are too expensive)
===============================================================================


===============================================================================
* BUG
===============================================================================
- Force mouse to stay inside application screen in windowed mode
- Check collision before placing building
- Ignore units behind HUD during 'selection mode'
- When starting pos of selection square is out of screen, some bar should be truncated
- When a peon is in 'CHOOSE_BUILDING' and goes unselected, it doesn't reset its state
- Rendering unit *flip* direction too often on certain condition [FIND ME]
- Unit get stuck on building corners
- Some path in path cache might need to be recompute if path becomes invalid
- Players with higher resolution can see *more things* than other players.

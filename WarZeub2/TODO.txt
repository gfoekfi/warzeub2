* FEATURE
===============================================================================
- path finding
- multiple unit selection
- smart unit selection (unit > building)
- new buildings: farm, barrack
- gold gathering
- music / sound
- alert system (not enough resource, under-attack...)
- sprite mirroring
- right click cancel a 'choose destination' order
- keyboard shortcut (grid / first letter)
- tree handling
- group selection save/restore handling
- fog of war
- render building that will be constructed
- font handling
- Building placement should be tiles aligned
- render minimap
- move with minimap
- write a README
===============================================================================


===============================================================================
* REFACTOR
===============================================================================
- unit 'moveState' / 'actionState' (/ 'hud state'), design is not clear
- unit order => polymorphism (read below)
- split *real* unit and building unit hierarchy (polymorphism)
- Map rendering should be done only on the viewport region
- Move DrawSelections() to the right place
- SDL actually sucks when a lots of sprite have to be displayed, switch to
  OpenGL/DirectX or uses the OpenGL mode of SDL (or maybe SDL2.0?)
- Clean not necessary header inclusions
- All the 'Sint16()' type conversion looks crappy (might change if we don't uses
  SDL anymore and its SDL_Rect)
- Uses bounding sphere instead of bounding box
===============================================================================


===============================================================================
* BUG
===============================================================================
- Make compilation works in RELEASE
- Force mouse to stay inside application screen in windowed mode
- Diagonal scrolling (in windowed mode)
- Check collision before placing building
- When unit pop-up after training or building, find a suitable location (with no collision)
- No scrolling on left side during 'selection mode'
- When starting pos of selection square is out of screen, some bar should be truncated

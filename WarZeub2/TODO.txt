- gold gathering
- music / sound
- alert system (not enough resource, under-attack...)
- sprite mirroring
- right click cancel a 'choose destination' order
- make most events effective on 'click down' instead of 'click up'
- keyboard shortcut (grid / first letter)

===============================================================================
* REFACTOR
===============================================================================
- unit 'moveState' / 'actionState' (/ 'hud state'), design is not clear
- split *real* unit and building unit hierarchy (polymorphism)
- UserInput start to get messy again
- UpdateSelection() might need to be moved somewhere else
- Map rendering should be done only on the viewport region
- It should be a state to specified when the user is in selecting mode
- Move DrawSelections() to the right place
- SDL actually sucks when a lots of sprite have to be displayed, switch to
  OpenGL/DirectX or uses the OpenGL mode of SDL (or maybe SDL2.0?)
- Clean not necessary header inclusions
- All the 'Sint16()' type conversion looks crappy (might change if we don't uses
  SDL anymore and its SDL_Rect)
===============================================================================


===============================================================================
* BUG
===============================================================================
- Make compilation works in RELEASE
- Force mouse to stay inside application screen in windowed mode
- Diagonal scrolling
- Check collision before placing building
